📚 Library Project — README

This program is a simple Library Management System. It acts like a small library where books are stored, and you (as the librarian or shop owner) can:

Add new books

Display all books

Search for books

Update book details

Delete books (for example, when a book is sold)

Count how many books are stored

It gives you the basic tools to manage a small collection of books.

🧭 How to Use the Commands

1) ➕ Add a new book

You enter: Title, Author, ID.

The book is stored in the first empty slot.

Use this when you want to add new data to the library.

2) 📋 Display all books

Prints all stored books.

Use this to check everything saved in the library.

3) 🔍 Search by ID

You enter a book ID.

Shows the book with that ID if found.

Use this if you know the ID code.

4) 🏷️ Search by Title

You enter a book Title.

Shows the book with that title if found.

Use this if you remember the name but not the ID.

5) 🗑️ Delete a book

⚠️ Important: you must enter the ID, not the title (bug in code).

Removes the book from the library.

Use this when you want to remove a record (for example, after selling the book).

6) ✏️ Update book information

You enter a book ID.

Then enter new Title and new Author.

Use this if you want to change or correct a book’s details.

7) 🔢 Count books

Shows how many books exist in the library.

⚠️ Counter may increase incorrectly if repeated many times without restart (bug in code).

Use this to know how many books you currently have.

8) 🚪 Exit

Ends the program.

Use this when you finish managing the library.
